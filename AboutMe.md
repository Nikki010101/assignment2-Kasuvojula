As a child, I always dreamed of making a positive contribution to society. At Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, I
was taught to be curious and to appreciate the finer nuances of subjects. This led me to score an impressive 10 CGPA in the board exams. Joining Sri Chaitanya Junior College gave me the inspiration I needed to follow my dreams.
Taking up Math, Physics and Chemistry laid the foundation for my degree in engineering. With a good score of
97.3%, I went to the Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology to pursue Civil Engineering. My
undergraduate program has given me broad and across-the-board exposure to core subjects like Engineering
Drawing, Engineering Mechanics, Building Materials and Construction Planning.And I am good at arts and craftsy, I really enjoy making something creative.
